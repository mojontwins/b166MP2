# Getting Started with IndustrialCraft

Industrial Craft is a mod designed to add in industrious blocks and items, obviously. The main item in IndustrialCraft is EU. EU (Energy Units) is created by generators which feed that energy to machines and/or energy storage devices. Machines do amazing things and make your Minecraft experience more comfortable. To help you get started making the most of this mod, get the basics out of the way.

Have a suitable shelter. If you want to build your machines inside the shelter, make your house decently big. If you don't think it's big enough, then simply add multiple floors of basement! This pack uses the Treecapitator mod in its build. Cutting down any block of a tree instantly harvests the whole thing. Clear the area of trees for room to work and adequate wood to work with. If you haven't already, gather some cobblestone and have a furnace available for smelting. Make sure you get a bed as soon as you can and arrange for storage. 6-12 chests will be sufficient in the beginning. Or, using the Iron Chests mod, create 5-6 chests using some copper or iron you found (Chest surrounded by the latter).

With your shelter, bed, smelting and storage allotted; begin making charcoal. Coal on its own is too precious to be burned for fuel. To begin your energy economy, start with Charcoal. Take a log and render it into planks. Then take those planks and render them into sticks. Taking two sticks, cook down a single log into one charcoal. Take that charcoal and cook down 8 more logs into 8 charcoal. Finally, using these 8 charcoal, cook down one stack of logs to make one stack of charcoal. This should be ample energy until you are ready to start making energy collectors.

Now that your energy and location are established, you are ready to begin the Industrial Craft experience. Begin by creating a Treetap. Rubber is essential to your basic crafting recipies and you will use this tool to collect Sticky Resin to make it. There are two types of Rubber Tree in this Pack: One is a dark colored tree with orange spots (IndustrailCraft Rubber Tree) and the other is a massive tree with a 3x3 trunk (Redpower Rubber Tree, has no orange spots, requires an Extractor to get rubber). Both will help you get rubber, but the dark one does so the most. The orange spots that appear on some sections of these trees are 'sap holes.' To get the resin you will need, take your Treetap and right-click the dotted side of the trunk and it will drop 1-3 pieces of resin. Repeat this process with as many of the trees you find until you have 12 or more. Bring these back to your shelter and smelt them into rubber. You'll also want to break the leaves of either tree to get a rubber tree sapling.

Now that you have rubber, you will need three minerals to finish the first stage of your first energy economy. You will need several blocks of Iron Ore, Tin Ore, Copper Ore and 8 pieces of Redstone. Obviously, you can mine the blocks with Stone Tools but will have to make at least one Iron Pickaxe to get the Redstone. There are hundreds of ways to get to level 40 and below to get the Redstone. The fastest and safest way is Flange Mining.

## Flange Mining

### The Shaft:

Start by finding a suitable place for your shaft. It should be as close to Sea Level (Level 64) as you can get. Start your shaft by digging a 2x1 hole in the ground and shelter the hole so nothing unwanted can fall down it. Since you have charcoal and likely many stacks of logs and planks left, get together enough sticks to make a single stack of 64 Ladders. Have with you at least 48 torches and secure the opening to your shaft with a door. Now that you have a secure shaft opening, start digging down into the earth while alternating between the two blocks going down. This way, you will open up a chasm or lava pool while standing on the block next to it; preventing falling damage or lava death. While going down, place your ladders on the door side and torches along the far side. This way you have uniform lighting and exit when you reach bottom.

### The Plunge:

When you reach level 14, stop digging down and expand the far wall to 3 blocks back. You are now forming your Plunge. This hallway will stretch 2x3 to the right and left of your ladder. As you move away from the ladder, you will be forming 'Flanges' that ensure maximum ore yeilds at this depth. The easiest way to go about it is to pick one side or the other and dig a 2 height hole into the wall. Then, two blocks to the right and two blocks to the left of that first hole, make another.

### The Flanges:

Your Flanges will go out from your Plunge to a desired depth in one direction. Using your own metric (Like placing a torch every 8-12 blocks) dig away from your Plunge.

### The Bleeder:

Once you get a fair distance away from your Plunge (Say 256 Meters), dig out a 2x2 area like you did at the base of the ladder. This is your Bleeder, a second hall running parrallel to your Plunge that gives you the ability to turn back and mine in the other direction, making sure you come out back where you started. Since you know that the other holes you dug are 2 blocks to either side of the Flange you just made, dig your Bleeder 3 blocks out to your right or left and begin mining back to your Flange. If you are filling up with materials or need new tools, go back to your shelter and make them. You have an efficient, predictable method of mining that will help you return back to the place you left off and continue.

## The Goods for the Charcoal Energy Economy

On your way down you likely ran into Iron, Copper and Tin Ores. You will want to find 19 Iron Ore and 16 or more Tin and at least 6 Copper. When you have your Iron Pickaxe, collect at least 8 Redstone. What you are procuring is the base minimum materials for the first stage of your Charcoal Energy Economy. When you have at least this much, return to your shelter, taking care not to loose any of these items.

The first Machines you must create are the Generator , the Macerator and the BatBox. The recipes listed require some other objects that should be simple to gather. The process is quick if you've gathered everything with you. First, Smelt your iron down into Iron Ingots, but only about half of it. Then take those same Ingots and put them back into the smelter. What you are creating is Refined Iron. In Industrial Craft, Iron is very precious and you are running out of it faster than most other materials. Rubber renews, Copper and Tin are plentiful in their layers and Redstone will choke your chests first. When able, avoid wasting Iron.

Once all 17 ore blocks become 17 Refined Iron, arrange them like you would a furnace to create two Machine Blocks and one left over ingot. Set these aside. Now smelt 6 Copper and 16 Tin. Using the Rubber you got earlier, craft 12 Copper Cables out of the 6 Copper Ingots. Take these cables, your Tin and your Red Stone and create 4 RE Batteries. You will make many more as you play Industrial Craft and will use them fairly frequently. For now, set these aside.

Now you should have two Machine Blocks , 4 RE Batteries , some planks, some cobblestone and some flint. Take some of your cobblestone and make a furnace. Combine a Battery, a Machine Block and the Furnace to create your first Generator. For now, this machine will burn fuel items in it's top slot and produce energy in the form of EU. By itself, the machine will supply EU, as long as a fuel item is burning, out any of its 6 sides. It can be set on top of or next to any machine and will supply it power. In addition, using some of the leftover cables you have, you can run cable along the ground, up the wall or through the air to a machine further away and conduct the energy there. However, there is no way to store this energy unless you have a BatBox .

Combine 3 RE Batteries, 5 Planks and 1 Cable to create the BatBox. The BatBox can be thought of as an energy storage device. It holds EU in its capacitor and discharges it into machines that are performing work. It will not transmit EU unless connected to a machine requesting EU. This means that, you can store your EU for later and not loose EU generated by your charcoal. It's your energy. You made it and you get to use it on your terms now that you have a BatBox.

The last stage of this economy is the Macerator. Remember how Iron Ore is precious? Even with a Macerator, you are running out of it quickly but now you'll do so half as fast. A Macerator reduces ores and other blocks into two piles of Dust. Dust can be smelted into ingots, doubling whatever amount of ore you bring up from your mine. Remember that left over Refined Iron Ingot? Take it, two Red Stone Dust and 6 cables and craft an Electronic Circuit. Again, you are going to be making several of these for other machines and tools. Remember this recipe well as it, like the Machine Block are the most important components to your 1st tier machinery. Combine 3 Flint, 2 Cobble Stone, 1 Machine Block and an Electronic Circuit to make your Macerator.

## Living the Charcoal Economy

You now have two Machines and one Storage Unit . You might wonder how to use them. Take your BatBox and find some place in your shelter/factory that is 2x2x1. The BatBox, like the Pistons of Vanilla Minecraft, face you when placed on a surface. Go up to the wall and place it on the ground. It should mount to the floor with its dot facing you. Take your Generator and place it on the wall right above your BatBox. It should mount to the top. With your Generator mounted to the top of your BatBox , take your Macerator and place it on the ground in front of the golden dot of your BatBox . It should mount to the floor, facing you and connect to the EU emitting face of your BatBox. Congratulations! You are living the Charcoal Economy.

If you've hooked the system up correctly, placing charcoal in the bottom slot of the generator will start producing EU. The EU will collect in the BatBox and start charging the internal capacitor. By right-clicking the BatBox , you can watch the EU totals increasing! To finish this first test, take an ore block of any type you like and place it in the Macerator. If the Energy Indicator is full or filling up (The Red Lightning Bolt) you are in business. From here, you can smelt the maximum amount of ingots from your ore and charge RE Batteries to craft new Tools and Machines. You are now making your already exciting Minecraft experience even more exciting! It only gets more amazing from here.

## Becoming a Tool Using Species

Now that you know how to create, charge and implement RE Batteries, it's time to start making your IndustrialCraft experience one of ease and enjoyment. First of all, RE Batteries are able to charge machines and objects reliably enough but they only store 10,000 EUs. Certainly enough to fill a tool but largely unnecessary. What you want is to make 6 RE Batteries, along with an electronic circuit and a tin ingot to create the BatPack.

Your first step in exiting the Charcoal Economy is going to be making a BatPack and the tools it works with. From here, you are obligated to at least make the following:

A Mining Drill/Diamond Drill: Chances are that you've already found some diamond if your Flange Mining is working out. If you have 3 of them, you can upgrade to the Diamond Drill straight away, allowing you to mine obsidian blocks faster than with a Diamond Pickaxe. The regular drill handles all other materials just fine so don't worry if you don't have enough to start with.

The Electric Treetap: Making Treetaps isn't hard or resource intensive, it's just a drag to monitor your uses or find you have a couple more sap holes left and the last tap has broken. All you need is 1 unused Treetap, an Electronic Circuit and an RE Battery and you're set. Now you can tap trees without stopping to see if your tool is going to hold up.

Other tools exist and whether or not you choose to make and implement them is up to you. Go by what you use most often in terms of heirarchy. Once this much is possible, you are ready to take on the next stage.

## Growing to the Renewable Economy

For now, you've got your Charcoal Fired Generator/BatBox/Macerator going. Maybe you've added an Electric Furnace or perhaps you've even gotten into extracting Sticky Resin with an Extrator? Either way, if you're still using RE Batteries by this point, you're wasting your valuable time. Where we go from here is totally up to you, however, Solar is recommended.

Solar Power is expensive, only works when the sun is out and requires big planning on your part; but when it's done up right, you won't ever have to worry about energy again. To get started, remember how you were told not to burn coal for energy? If you've mined it and kept it around in a chest or at least left it in the rock where you found it, rejoice. You have the materials. If not, head back down to your flange and come back up with about 3 stacks of 25 coal.

Take the coal and put it in your macerator. It will take a while, but when all the coal is turned to Coal Dust, set it aside. If you haven't messed with sand yet or a desert is not conveneintly near by, explore for sand and come back with 3 stacks of 25 as well. Smelt these into glass and set them asside. Now is where the effort comes in. To make your Solar Panels work the most efficiently, you will need 50 Electronic Circuits and 25 Generators . Just in terms of raw materials, that means:

25 Generators: 200 Refined Iron =25 Machine Blocks / 25 RE Batteries =25 Copper Cables, 50 Red Stone, 100 Tin

50 Electronic Circuits: 50 Refined Iron , 100 Red Stone, 300 Copper Cables plus another 50 for good measure.

If that seems like a lot, it is. Solar Panels are the most expensive means of collecting EU but the easiest and trouble free when installed. Just getting the Solar Panels made is the hard part. At least from here, it's just a matter of installing them. And to do that, you should get a Wrench.

Wrenches are made from Bronze which is smelted from Bronze Dust . You will need 6 ingots of Bronze to make your first one. The Wrench is an essential but fickle tool. On most occasions, when Right-Clicking on a machine/storage unit/energy generator, the Wrench will dismount the object allowing you to collect it. However, there is a small chance that the Wrench will only give you back the Machine Block or the Energy Generator you used to make the machine/storage unit/energy generator. This is a frustrating chance to take, which is why it's essential to make sure you've set down the object in the correct place.

Now that you have your 'mistake tool,' you're ready to put them together. Take your Solar Panels and your cables and find a proper spot on your map. The location is up to you but should include ample space for building, be several meters off the ground and be free of obstruction to the sun. There is a means by which to get BatBoxes involved, but for now, it's simple enough to use the cables. What you are creating is a Solar Flower. It starts with a single Solar Panel with a single cable below it. Then, off of the cable, place 4 more Solar Panels on all 4 adjacent sides. Place another cable below the first one and branch off 4 cables out from each face. On the 8 sides you've just created, place the next 8 panels. By now you probably see where the last 12 are going to go once you get the cables in place. The object will be 4X4 in a diagonal fashion and be 4 meters high at the pinacle.

With the cables coming down, you can conveniently place BatBoxes and run cables from them to machines. With storage connected to your ample solar supply, you will seldom, if ever, run out of energy to run your machines. Welcome to the Renewable Economy.

##More EU Generation Options
Solar Panels are great and all, but what if you're machines are running in the night, when solar panels are doing nothing, and your Energy Storage device is running on empty? Make more generaters! I don't mean literal fuel powered generators, I mean more things that produce EU, such as the Water Mill. It generates only 0.01 EU per tick, but having a lot of these around will get you quite a decent amount of energy. They are also relatively cheap to craft, requiring only a generator and some planks and sticks. The crafting recipe also wields 2 water mills each. To get them working, place then in a river or lake or some sort of body of water. Run cables out of the top or bottom of the mill, but not the sides. Tin cable works great with water mills, as they are cheap to craft and can take the low EU amount they generate. Water buckets can also be palced in the water mill, and this will generate 2 EU/t. But this is inefficient because, well, you're scrambling around, filling the buckets and putting them in the mills. As mentioned before, these on their own don't give much power, but 10-20 can get you a VERY nice amount of EU.
